👋 Hello! I'm **Dusty Saker**, a **Traveler ✈️ | Fullstack Developer 💻 | Entrepreneur** 🚀 based in the United States. <br /> <br />
🔭 I am currently developing [TalkLikeTv](https://github.com/dsaker/echo-oapi-tltv), a language learning application designed to address limitations I’ve encountered in other popular language learning apps, such as Pimsleur, Babbel, and Duolingo. While these tools serve as strong foundational resources, I’ve found that they tend to plateau once reaching an intermediate level. Currently, I can understand French and Spanish well enough to follow audiobooks and read at a high level, but I still face challenges in expressing myself and comprehending native speakers during travel.<br /> <br />
To overcome these barriers, I’ve created an application that generates a Pimsleur-like audio course from any file the user selects. Personally, I use subtitles from current TV shows from the countries I plan to visit. This approach has several benefits: it familiarizes me with contemporary slang, improves my understanding of spoken dialogue, and challenges me to express myself more naturally. Practicing with these audio files not only enhances comprehension of the shows but also provides an immersive, effective way to advance my language skills.
